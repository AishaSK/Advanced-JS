# Advanced-JS
An app used to generate a random password on criteria selected. Will run in browser, feature updated HTML/CSS powered by JS. Will have a clean  interface, responsive,  adapts to screen sizes.

I Was given all starter code and have made chnages to meet the criteria below;
Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
Length of password must be At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
Character types must include:
Lowercase
Uppercase
Numeric
Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
